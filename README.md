# ARKsAssistant
Welcome to ARKsAssistant! An assistant written on python using two main softwares, [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) and [Pyttsx3](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3).

It was created with a goal: **to allow the user, layback and command their system to do whatever they wish without the need to click a button!**

To achieve this goal many features have been included. This assistant is able to change many of its values using a simple debug menu. It is able to modify its own modules and have other python files, set by the user, as a local module, to use its functions.

Key Features:
- Interchangable Modules
- Modify Voice Recognition Vosk
- Modify Text To Speach Voices Online/Offline
- Use [NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter](https://github.com/gexgd0419/NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter)
- Change/Add/Delete Commands
- Use the set of available functions or add your own ones
- Send messages to your Arduino board
- Have different sounds, including startup/shutdown sounds
- Select an option from a list via voice, using the ask_single_entry function
- Useful commands such as: Weather, Crypto, Arduino, Youtube Music API, Media Controls, Keyboard Inputs, Play Audio, Play Video, etc.

## Debug Menu
With the use of [Urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid), a simple dubug menu has been made to modify the config.json file for the assistant. Via this menu you are able to change the Behavior, Voices, Vosk, do backup of the modules, Set commands and more. Each section of the debug menu has its own guide, **(WORK IN PROGRESS...)** both simple and complete, to guide fellow programmes or users who are here to enjoy.
